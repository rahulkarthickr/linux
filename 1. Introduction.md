# Introduction to Linux

### What is Linux?

- Linux is a free and open-source operating system (OS) based on Unix
- It is widely used for its stability , security , flexibility
- The core component of Linux is the kernel , which manages the system's resources and allows software and hardware to communicate

### How Does Linux Work?

- Linux works through a combination of the kernel , system libraries , system utilities , user applications
- Kernel interacts directly with the hardware , while the system libraries & utilities provide a standardized interface for applications

### Bootloader

- Bootloader is the first software that runs when a computer starts
- It loads the Linux kernel into memory and starts its execution
- Common bootloaders include GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) and LILO (Linux Loader)

### Kernel

- Kernel is the core of the Linux operating system
- It manages system resources such as the CPU , memory , hardware devices
- Kernel ensures that apps can run simultaneously without interfering with each other

### Init System

- Init system is responsible for initializing the system and starting essential services after the kernel has booted
- It also handles the shutdown process
- Common init systems include System V init , Upstart , systemd

### Daemons

- Daemons are background processes that run continuously and provide various services , such as web server functionality , etc.,
- They typically start at boot time and remain running until the system is shut down

### Terminal Emulator

- Terminal emulator is a program that lets you use the terminal in a graphical way i.e., it is the emulator for the terminal

### Command Shell

- Shell is a CLI that takes commands as input, helps in converting commands to instructions to computer and tells the OS what to do

### Environment Variables

- Named values that are used to change how the commands and processes are being executed are called Environment variables
- Any instance of a running command is called a process
- Whenever we try to run any command , it will first its path and execute it
- Then , secret passwords are stored as seperate environment path variables for security purposes
- Ex . When we are execute `git` command in the cmd , it lists all its available operations
- This is achieved via storing the `git` as environment variables which are actually executable files

### Graphical Server

- Graphical server , also known as the X server or Wayland , provides the graphical environment for users
- It handles the display , input devices , window management
-  Users interact with the graphical server through a desktop environments

### Applications

- Linux supports a wide range of applications , from command-line tools to full-featured desktop software
- Users can find applications for productivity , development , entertainment , and more
- Popular applications include the LibreOffice suite , VLC , etc.,

### Why Use Linux?

- Open Source: Linux is free to use , modify , and distribute
- Stability and Performance: Linux is known for its reliability and efficient resource management
- Security: Linux has a strong security model , making it less vulnerable to malware and attacks
- Customization: Users can tailor their Linux system to their specific needs
- Community Support: A large , active community provides extensive documentation and support

### What is a Distribution?

- A Linux distribution (distro) is a packaged version of the Linux operating system that includes the kernel , system software , apps
- Distros may cater to different use cases , from desktop environments to server setups , custom tools , configurations

### Popular Linux Distros

- Ubuntu: A user-friendly distro with strong community support , suitable for beginners
- Fedora: Known for its cutting-edge features and technologies , often used by developers
- Debian: A stable and versatile distro , popular for both desktops and servers
- Arch Linux: A minimalist and highly customizable distro for advanced users
- CentOS: A community-driven version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux , ideal for servers
- Linux Mint: Aimed at providing a smooth and easy-to-use desktop experience
